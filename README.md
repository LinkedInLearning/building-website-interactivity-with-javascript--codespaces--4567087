## Instructions

This repository has directories for each chapter in the course, with subfolders for each video.  Most of the videos have live coding exercises, and have both a begin and end folder showing the files in their state at the beginning of that video, and at its end.

It is assumed that you'll be coding along with the instructor.  In many cases there is a work-in-progress folder in each chapter named `wip` that you can use to follow along.

This course does not uses branches. Everything is contained in the `main` branch.

## Installing

1. To use these exercise files, you should have the following installed:
	- A text editor or IDE like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [WebStorm](https://jetbrains.com/webstorm/)
    - A preferred web browser.  If you can read this document, you already do!
2. Clone this repository into your local machine using the terminal (Mac), CMD (Windows), or a GUI tool like [Fork](https://fork.dev/). 
   - You can also download the files by choosing Download Zip under the Code dropdown button. 

## Codespaces

This course is designed to be run in GitHub Codespaces.  To do this, fork the repository to your own account using the Fork button near the top of the window.  

Once you have your copy of the repository, click the green Code dropdown button, where you'll find a Codespaces tab. From there you can start a Codespace the way you'll see in the course.   [Codespaces are free](https://github.com/features/codespaces#pricing) up to a certain level of hourly usage per month, and [you can pay for more](https://github.com/features/codespaces#pricing) if needed.
